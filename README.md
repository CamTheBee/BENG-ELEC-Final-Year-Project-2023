# BENG-ELEC-Final-Year-Project-2023
A repository to store my BEng Electrical and Electronic Engineering Code for my Final Year Project 2023.
A lot of the code for this project was created via a cloned version of the Plymouth University Embedded Systems repository and from my C drive. This means that there is not many commits and this repository should be viewed more as a storage for the project code.

# Contains
- Some Task files from the UoP Embedded Systems repository for testing.
- SD Device Mbed file.
- BLE files from Mbed for testing.
- Project Sampling code.
- MATLAB Code - Testing wavelet alogroithms, using Arduino for reading pins and basic quantisation for proof of concept.
